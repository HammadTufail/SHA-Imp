This project is implementation Floyd Algorithm and Dijkstra Algorithm for finding shortest  distance.
It takes a file with N lines , each line representing 3 values seperated by space.
First value represents source vertex , second value represents second value and third value represents weight of the edge between source and destination.
It maps all the values and then it asks user for starting vertex and ending vertex , telling the shortest  path.
